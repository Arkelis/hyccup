Hyccup - Generate HTML from data structure in Hy and Python
===========================================================


Hyccup is a port of `Hiccup <https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup>`_ for 
`Hy <https://github.com/hylang/hy>`_ and Python. It allows you to represent
HTML into data structure and to dump it:

.. tab:: Hy

   .. code-block:: clj

      => (import hyccup [html])
      => (html ["div" {"class" "greeting"} "Hello Hyccup from Hy!"])
      "<div class=\"greeting\">Hello Hyccup from Hy!</div>"

.. tab:: Python

   .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> from hyccup import html
      >>> html(["div", {"class": "greeting"}, "Hello Hyccup from Python!"])
      '<div class="greeting">Hello Hyccup from Python!</div>'
